// Either way, given that if we can start the MQTT client, that means a TLS handshake occurred,
// and the wifi was strong enough to get the connection established.  In this scenario, and
// since getting the data to the broker is critical in our application, we would like to "retry"

// As of 7/22/22 one JSON packet of 10 FIFO blocks was taking about 0.8 seconds
// to transmit, so 100 seconds gives us about 125 FIFO blocks max per transmit

// can discern.  So this should keep us caught up if we have a WIFI connection
// In fall 2022, Sarah at Bricksimple reported that it was "slow" to catch up
// after missing WIFI for a while.
// 1/10/23 analysis and discussion with Marc Ryba, decided to expand to
// around 3 minute transmit interval in order to catch up faster.

// per interval we can catch up 2 hours worth of buffered data in 15 minutes
